            This is a project using simulation techniques, that I had learnt. This project
            was done with substantial mentoring by a very helpful medical professional. It simulated
            the long term benefits of surgery to treat obese patients who had Type-2 diabetes over their lifetime. I 
            am also grateful to my Computer Science teachers for teaching me simulation.
