        <h3>2. Contains A Lot of Nicotine </h3>
        <p>
            There's misinformation that vaping is less dangerous, specifically contains less nicotine, than cigarettes. But, any amount of nicotine is dangerous and levels of nicotine within vape is similar to cigarettes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>But what's dangerous about nicotine?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Nicotine harms parts of the brain, especially if it's still developing, that control attention, learning, mood, and impulse control. Additionally, vape will increase the risk of getting addicted to other drugs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even worse, many e-cigarettes don't include that they contain nicotine, convincing many victims of indulging in these toxins.
        </p>

    <div class="symptom">
        <h3>
            3. IT'S ADDICTIVE!
        </h3>

        </p>
        <p>

            4. Inhaling Harmful Substances
        </h3>
        <p>
            What you inhale from vaping isn't just water vapor, nicotine, and smoke. E-cigarettes contain many micro metals and dangerous chemicals, found to lead to various diseases and cancer. Some metals include 
        </p>
        <p>
            nickel, tin, and kead. Additionally, there are flavorings such as diacetyl, a chemical found to cause serious lung damage. Even worse, some e-cigarettes are marketed as nicotine free and contain nothing about chemicals.
        </p>
        <p>
            This makes it difficult for consumers to know what they're inhaling.

            5. External Dangers
        </h3>

            or younger. Outside of poisoning, e-cigarettes can explode. Yes, fires have been caused, and people have suffered from serious injuries. Plus, the second hand smoke from vapers can also affect those 
        </p>
        <p>
            nearby negatively, since second hand smoke is more dangerous than first hand.
